# Getting Started with C# #

This repository contains my own personal solutions to *Getting Started with C#* [tutorials](https://www.microsoft.com/net/tutorials/csharp/getting-started)' exercices by Microsoft.

If this is your first time, you must:

1. Download and install [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core);
2. Clone or download this repository.

If you have done that already, you should:

1. Access your CLI and change the current working directory to the desired example's subdirectory (ex. `cd /Users/praefica/Downloads/getting-started-with-csharp-master/01-Creating-a-Hello-World-Program`);
2. Run `dotnet restore`, which will restore the packages specified in the *project.json* file;
3. And finally run `dotnet run`, which will run the actual sample.

Enjoy! â˜•
